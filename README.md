# Client Side Work

1. Add a navigation bar and a card section to my client side. There are four routes in Naviber: home, post, create-post, and authentication. and below the card section.
2. In the home page card part, I retrieve data from my server, which I made in express js. There is an image, title, blog description, author name, published date, and two buttons (edit and delete). Here the description is limited, and when you click to read more, you go to the particular route where you see the entire post description for this particular post.
3. In the post route, I show all blog data to the server.
4. Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for the home page and post page using Next. js getServerSideProps and getServerSidePaths functions to fetch blog posts and individual post data, respectively. Only a user can see the home page details, but if he/she accesses the blog description, post route, or create-post route, he /she must be authenticated.

# Server Side work

1. On the server side, I create a server using node.js and express.js and create a data.json file where I save all my data to access.
2. Then, in virtual mode, run the server in vercel and call it from the client.
